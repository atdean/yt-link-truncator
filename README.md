This is a simple tool that takes Youtube links and truncates the URL to include nothing more than the raw video link.

I often share videos from Youtube that have tons of extra metadata and analytics strings, or that start from a specific time partway through the video if I clicked through to it directly from another site a video was embedded in.

This is a simple CLI tool that truncates those extra elements from the URL, so that you can share the pure Youtube link without having to manually remove all of these extra URL components.
